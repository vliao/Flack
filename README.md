# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Done: 
User enters a display name the first time they visit. this name is associated with messages they send
Users can create new channels
Users see a list of channels and can navigate to each channel to see messages in that channel
Users can send messages and see the messages appear. 

TODO:
logging out a user and loggin in as a different user. 
Timestamp isn't stored. potentially would want to store message objects: with name, message, and timestamp. 
Change application flow: adding a new channel shouldn't be to a different route than the initial log in.
